<h1>My first shell</h1> 

<h2>Commands</h2>
pwd To indicate where we are.<br>
ls To list things in the current position.<br>
cd To navigate through the directory.<br>
ls -l. To list in a long format<br>
ls -la. To show a long format + documents that are not visible usually.<br>
mkdir To create directory. <br>
ln. Means Link! Like my favourite character of all time. This command send us to the route indicated. <br>
cp. Means copy, we can make it better if we add (*) (n) or (u) -- Describe this better in the future. But basically it was to copy the html files from a directory to another one. <br>
mv. Move a file<br>

<h2>Make it a script </h2> 

With this command we start every document. !#/bin/bash <br>

/bin is where all the Linux commands are located. <br>
We need to make it a script no a text document by adding chmod u+x thenameofthefilestoconvert<br>
To test each script we need to ./thenameofthefiletotry<br>
