<h1>My first shell</h1> 

<h2>Commands</h2>
pwd To indicate where we are.
ls To list things in the current position.
cd To navigate through the directory.
ls -l. To list in a long format
ls -la. To show a long format + documents that are not visible usually.
mkdir To create directory. 
ln. Means Link! Like my favourite character of all time. This command send us to the route indicated. 
cp. Means copy, we can make it better if we add (*) (n) or (u) -- Describe this better in the future. But basically it was to copy the html files from a directory to another one. 
mv. Move a file

<h2>Make it a script </h2> 

With this command we start every document. !#/bin/bash 

/bin is where all the Linux commands are located. 
We need to make it a script no a text document by adding chmod u+x thenameofthefilestoconvert
To test each script we need to ./thenameofthefiletotry
